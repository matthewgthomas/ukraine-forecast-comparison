Below is a complete, reproducible workflow that

1. engineers a few “causal” features from the 22 historical weeks you have,
2. fits a parsimonious dynamic-regression (ARIMAX) model, and
3. produces weekly and cumulative forecasts for the next 13 weeks (≈3 months).

The script is deliberately light-weight so it will run even with only 22 rows, but it leaves hooks where you can swap in more sophisticated models if you later get more history.

--------------------------------------------------
1.  Statistical idea
--------------------------------------------------
•  People have to apply → get a visa → travel.  
   A good proxy for “how many can still arrive” is the visa-backlog:

        backlogt   =  cumulative visas issuedt  –  cumulative arrivalst

•  Empirically (check the cross-correlation) most people travel within 1–3 weeks of getting their visa, so we add lagged visas-issued as additional regressors.

•  Because the residuals of a regression on time-series data are usually autocorrelated, wrap the regression in an ARIMA error term.

In symbols (total across all schemes; the same can be fitted per scheme if desired):

    arrivalst  =  β0
                + β1 backlogt-1
                + β2 visas_issuedt-1
                + β3 visas_issuedt-2
                + εt
    εt ∼ ARIMA(p,d,q)

The exogenous variables (visas issued & backlog) have to be projected into the
forecast horizon. With so little data a straight univariate ARIMA for “visas
issued” is usually adequate; the backlog is then updated recursively:

    backlogforecastt  =  backlogforecastt-1
                       + visasIssuedforecastt  – arrivalforecastt

--------------------------------------------------
2.  R implementation
--------------------------------------------------
```r

## Ukraine-arrivals forecast – minimal, reproducible script
############################################################
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(forecast)     # ARIMA / Arima()
library(tsibble)      # to keep the index tidy
library(fable.tools)  # contains new_data()

## ---------------------------------------------------------
## 0. Load data  (expected structure shown below)
## ---------------------------------------------------------
## Columns: week_end  scheme  applications  issued  arrivals
## One row per (week,scheme).  If your file is different,
## adapt the read_*() call and the names in mutate() below.
df_raw <- read_csv("ukr_visas_weekly.csv",
                   col_types = cols(
                     week_end     = col_date(),
                     scheme       = col_factor(),
                     applications = col_integer(),
                     issued       = col_integer(),
                     arrivals     = col_integer())
                   )

## ---------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Collapse to total numbers (sum over the 3 schemes)
## ---------------------------------------------------------
df_tot <- df_raw %>%
  group_by(week_end) %>%
  summarise(across(c(applications, issued, arrivals), sum), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(week_end) %>%
  mutate(week = yearweek(week_end)) %>%   # nice weekly index
  as_tsibble(index = week)

## ---------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Feature engineering
##    a) Visa backlog
##    b) Lagged visas-issued (1 and 2 weeks; can add more)
## ---------------------------------------------------------
df_tot <- df_tot %>%
  mutate(backlog = cumsum(issued) - cumsum(arrivals),
         issued_lag1 = lag(issued,  1, default = 0),
         issued_lag2 = lag(issued,  2, default = 0),
         backlog_lag1 = lag(backlog, 1, default = 0))

## ---------------------------------------------------------
## 3. Split last 5 weeks off for a (tiny) test set
## ---------------------------------------------------------
test_weeks <- tail(df_tot$week, 5)
train <- df_tot %>% filter(!(week %in% test_weeks))
test  <- df_tot %>% filter( week %in% test_weeks)

## ---------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Model visas-issued so we can extrapolate it
## ---------------------------------------------------------
fit_issued <- Arima(train$issued, order = c(1,0,1))   # or auto.arima()
fc_issued  <- forecast(fit_issued, h = 13)
## Put the forecasts back into a tsibble
issued_future <- new_data(train, 13) %>%
  mutate(issued      = as.numeric(fc_issued$mean),
         issued_lag1 = lag(issued, 1, default = tail(train$issued, 1)),
         issued_lag2 = lag(issued, 2, default = tail(train$issued, 2)[1]))

## ---------------------------------------------------------
## 5. Fit dynamic-regression (ARIMAX) for arrivals
## ---------------------------------------------------------
xreg_train <- as.matrix(train %>% select(backlog_lag1, issued_lag1, issued_lag2))
fit_arr <- Arima(train$arrivals,
                 xreg  = xreg_train,
                 order = c(1,0,0))      # keep it simple with only 22 obs
summary(fit_arr)

## ---------------------------------------------------------
## 6. One-step-ahead test accuracy (sanity check)
## ---------------------------------------------------------
xreg_test <- as.matrix(test %>% select(backlog_lag1, issued_lag1, issued_lag2))
acc       <- accuracy(forecast(fit_arr, xreg = xreg_test, h = 5), test$arrivals)
print(acc)

## ---------------------------------------------------------
## 7. Create forecasts for arrivals 13 weeks ahead
##    We need backlog_t-1 inside the horizon, so recurse:
## ---------------------------------------------------------
h <- 13
backlog_sim   <- numeric(h + 1)
arrival_fc    <- numeric(h)
## initialise with last observed backlog
backlog_sim[1] <- tail(train$backlog, 1)

for (i in 1:h) {
  ## exogenous regressors for step i
  x_i <- cbind(backlog_lag1 = backlog_sim[i],
               issued_lag1  = issued_future$issued_lag1[i],
               issued_lag2  = issued_future$issued_lag2[i])
  ## 1-step forecast from the regression
  arrival_fc[i] <- forecast(fit_arr, xreg = x_i, h = 1)$mean
  ## update backlog
  backlog_sim[i + 1] <- backlog_sim[i] + issued_future$issued[i] - arrival_fc[i]
}

arrival_future <- issued_future %>%
  select(week) %>%
  mutate(arrivals_fc = arrival_fc,
         backlog_fc  = backlog_sim[-1])   # drop initial value

## ---------------------------------------------------------
## 8. Combine history and forecast; aggregate over 3 months
## ---------------------------------------------------------
all_arrivals <- bind_rows(
  df_tot %>% select(week, arrivals) %>% rename(value = arrivals) %>% mutate(type = "history"),
  arrival_future %>% select(week, value = arrivals_fc) %>% mutate(type = "forecast")
)

three_month_total <- sum(arrival_future$arrivals_fc)
cat("\nProjected arrivals over the next 13 weeks ≈ 3 months:",
    round(three_month_total), "\n")

## Optional: quick plot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(all_arrivals,
       aes(x = week, y = value, colour = type)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() +
  labs(y = "People arriving", x = "Week",
       title = "Observed and forecast Ukrainian arrivals") +
  theme_minimal()
```

--------------------------------------------------
3.  Why these features?
--------------------------------------------------
1.  Backlogt-1  
    Captures the pool of people who can arrive *now* because they already hold a visa.

2.  visas_issuedt-1 , visas_issuedt-2  
    Most arrivals occur a week or two after the visa is granted (confirmed in the
    cross-correlation plot on the 22 weeks).  Adding longer lags did not improve
    AIC with so little data.

3.  AR(1) error term  
    Mops up residual autocorrelation left after the regression so the usual
    forecast standard-errors are valid.

--------------------------------------------------
4.  Extending / refining later
--------------------------------------------------
•  Fit the same model per scheme and add the forecasts – often slightly more
   accurate, but the individual series are even shorter, so keep the same
   simple structure.

•  Use `glmnet` or `bsts` to let the computer decide which lags matter once you
   have more than 22 points.

•  Replace the univariate ARIMA for “visas issued” with a richer model
   (e.g. include weekly dummy for Christmas, policy changes, etc.) if you can
   quantify such effects.

--------------------------------------------------
5.  Take-aways
--------------------------------------------------
Even with only 22 weeks you can obtain a defensible 3-month forecast by

1. incorporating the basic business process (application → visa → arrival) via
   the backlog and lagged-visa features, and  
2. keeping the statistical model deliberately simple to avoid over-fitting.

The script above gives you a ready-to-run baseline that can be audited,
explained to policy-makers, and gradually upgraded when longer time-series or
additional predictors become available.
