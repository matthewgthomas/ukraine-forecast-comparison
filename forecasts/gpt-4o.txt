To forecast the number of people arriving from Ukraine in the next three months using the provided data, we can implement a time series forecasting model in R. We'll utilize the given weekly data for visa applications, visas issued, types of visas, and arrivals. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Data Preparation

1. **Load the Data:**
   Load the weekly data into R, ensuring it is in a time series format.

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Example of loading data (replace with actual data)
data <- read.csv("ukraine_visa_data.csv")
data$date <- ymd(data$date)
```

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Calculate the conversion rates: `visas_issued/visa_applications` and `arrivals/visas_issued`.
   - Create lag features: previous weeks' data to capture trends.

```r
data <- data %>%
  mutate(conversion_rate_applications = visas_issued / visa_applications,
         conversion_rate_visas = arrivals / visas_issued,
         lag_1_arrivals = lag(arrivals),
         lag_2_arrivals = lag(arrivals, 2),
         lag_3_arrivals = lag(arrivals, 3))
```

3. **Encoding Visa Types:**
   Convert categorical visa types to numerical features using one-hot encoding.

```r
data <- data %>%
  mutate(ukraine_family_scheme = if_else(type_of_visa == "Ukraine Family Scheme", 1, 0),
         ukraine_sponsorship_scheme = if_else(type_of_visa == "Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme", 1, 0),
         government_sponsored = if_else(type_of_visa == "Government sponsored", 1, 0))
```

### Step 2: Model Selection

Use time series models such as ARIMA or machine learning models like Random Forest to predict future arrivals. 

#### Using ARIMA:
- ARIMA models are well-suited for time series data. After preprocessing, we can build an ARIMA model.

```r
library(forecast)

# Prepare the time series data
ts_data <- ts(data$arrivals, frequency = 52)  # Weekly data

# Fit the ARIMA model
arima_model <- auto.arima(ts_data)

# Forecast the next 12 weeks (3 months)
forecasted_values <- forecast(arima_model, h = 12)

# Plot the forecast
plot(forecasted_values)
```

### Step 3: Evaluate and Iterate

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Fine-tune the model by adding more features or trying different models if necessary.

### Step 4: Interpretation

- Review forecast results and communicate findings.
- Use them to inform stakeholders or policy-makers about expected arrivals.

This template gives a foundational approach to forecasting with the provided data. You can enhance this by iterating on feature engineering, trying different modeling approaches, or incorporating additional external data sources to improve accuracy.
