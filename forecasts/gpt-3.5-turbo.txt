To forecast the number of people from Ukraine arriving in the country in the next 3 months, we can utilize time series forecasting techniques in R. The first step is to preprocess the available data to engineer new features that may help improve the accuracy of the forecast.

Here is a suggested approach:

1. Calculate the approval rate by dividing the number of visas issued by the number of visa applications. This can give an indication of the efficiency of the visa process.

2. Create dummy variables for the type of visa categories ("Ukraine Family Scheme", "Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme", and "Government sponsored"). This can help capture any potential trends or patterns associated with different visa types.

3. Calculate the average number of people with visas arriving in the country per week. This can provide a baseline for expected arrivals.

Once these new features are engineered, we can then use a time series forecasting model, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or Prophet, to forecast the number of people arriving from Ukraine in the next 3 months.

Here is an example code snippet in R to get you started:

```R
# Load required libraries
library(fpp2) # For time series forecasting
library(dplyr) # For data manipulation

# Read the data
data <- read.csv("data.csv") # Replace "data.csv" with the actual file name

# Engineer new features
data$approval_rate <- data$visas_issued / data$visa_applications

# Create dummy variables for visa types
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    Ukraine_Family_Scheme = ifelse(Type_of_visa == "Ukraine Family Scheme", 1, 0),
    Ukraine_Sponsorship_Scheme = ifelse(Type_of_visa == "Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme", 1, 0),
    Government_sponsored = ifelse(Type_of_visa == "Government sponsored", 1, 0)
  )

# Calculate average arrivals per week
average_arrivals <- mean(data$people_arriving_with_visas)

# Time series forecasting
ts_data <- ts(data$people_arriving_with_visas, start = c(year, week), frequency = 52)
model <- auto.arima(ts_data)
forecast <- forecast(model, h = 12) # Forecast for the next 3 months (12 weeks)

# Print forecast
print(forecast)
```

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to adjust the code according to your specific data structure and requirements. Additionally, you may need to fine-tune the forecasting model parameters and evaluate the forecast's accuracy using appropriate metrics.
